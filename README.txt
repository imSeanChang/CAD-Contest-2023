1. To compile the code, use the command "make cadd0020"
2. To run the exe binary, use the command "./cadd0020_alpha [input file] [output file]"
3. To delete the exe binary, use the command "make clean"
P.S. If the the exe binary is in the directory, "make cadd0020" won't work unless you delete the exe binary first
